2. **Click "Configure Patterns"** to open the options page

3. **Modify existing patterns** or **add new ones**:
   - **Pattern Name**: A friendly name (e.g., "ServiceNow Incident")
   - **Regular Expression**: The pattern to match (e.g., `INC\\d{7,}`)
   - **URL Template**: The URL with `{value}` placeholder (e.g., `https://your-instance.service-now.com/nav_to.do?uri=incident.do?sysparm_query=number={value}`)

4. **Click "Save All Changes"**

## Pattern Examples

### Custom Ticket System
- **Pattern**: `TICKET-[A-Z0-9]+`
- **Matches**: TICKET-ABC123, TICKET-XYZ789
- **URL Template**: `https://tickets.yourcompany.com/view/{value}`

## Regular Expression Tips

- `\\d` matches any digit (0-9)
- `\\d+` matches one or more digits
- `\\d{7,}` matches 7 or more digits
- `[A-Z]` matches any uppercase letter
- `[A-Z]+` matches one or more uppercase letters
- `[A-Z]{2,}` matches 2 or more uppercase letters
- `.` matches any character
- `.*` matches any characters (zero or more)
- `^` matches start of string
- `$` matches end of string

## URL Template Placeholder

Use `{value}` in your URL template where you want the matched clipboard text to be inserted.

Examples:
- `https://example.com/ticket/{value}`
- `https://example.com/search?q={value}`
- `https://example.com/{value}/details`

## Handling Overlapping Patterns

The extension will launch a URL for **every** pattern that matches the text in your clipboard or selection, not just the first one. This is a powerful feature that allows you to open a work item in multiple systems at once.

For example, imagine your clipboard contains the text `TASK-12345`, and you have two patterns configured:

1.  **Name**: "Jira Task"
    *   **Pattern**: `TASK-\\d+`
    *   **URL**: `https://my-jira.com/browse/{value}`

2.  **Name**: "General Work Item"
    *   **Pattern**: `[A-Z]+-\\d+`
    *   **URL**: `https://our-work-search.com/items/{value}`

In this case, the extension will open **two** tabs: one for Jira and one for your general work search.

If you have broad patterns that overlap with more specific ones, you can use the "Enabled" checkbox in the options to temporarily disable any patterns you don't want to launch.

## Permissions

This extension requires the following permissions:

- **clipboardRead**: To read the clipboard content
- **storage**: To save your custom patterns
- **tabs**: To open new tabs with matched URLs
- **contextMenus**: To add the "Launch" option to the right-click menu
- **offscreen**: To read the clipboard from the background without opening a popup window

## Troubleshooting

### Extension doesn't read clipboard
- Make sure you've granted clipboard permissions
- Click "Read Clipboard & Launch" button to trigger permission request
- Some browsers may require user interaction before reading clipboard

### Pattern not matching
- Verify your regular expression is correct
- Test your pattern at [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/)
- Make sure the pattern is enabled (checkbox is checked)
- Check that there are no extra spaces in your clipboard text

### URL not opening
- Verify the URL template is correct
- Make sure `{value}` placeholder is included in the URL
- Check browser console for any errors

## Customization Ideas

- **Support Tickets**: Match ticket numbers and open support system
- **Pull Requests**: Match PR numbers and open GitHub/GitLab
- **Wiki Pages**: Match wiki IDs and open documentation
- **Customer IDs**: Match customer IDs and open CRM
- **Order Numbers**: Match order IDs and open order management system
- **Employee IDs**: Match employee IDs and open HR system

## Privacy

This extension:
- Only reads clipboard when you click the extension icon or use the context menu
- Stores patterns locally in Chrome sync storage
- Does not send any data to external servers
- Does not track or collect user data

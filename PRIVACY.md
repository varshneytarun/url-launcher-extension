# Privacy Policy for Smart URL Launcher

**Last updated:** February 7, 2026

## Overview
Smart URL Launcher is committed to protecting your privacy. This privacy policy explains our data practices for the Chrome and Microsoft Edge extension.

## Data Collection
**We do NOT collect, store, or transmit any personal data.**

Smart URL Launcher operates entirely on your local device and does not:
- Collect personal information
- Track your browsing activity
- Send data to external servers
- Use analytics or tracking tools
- Store data on remote servers

## Data Storage
The extension stores the following data **locally on your device only**:

### Browser Sync Storage
- **URL patterns** you configure in the options page
- **Pattern settings** (enabled/disabled state)

This data is:
- Stored using your browser's built-in sync storage (Chrome Sync or Microsoft Edge Sync)
- Synchronized across your browsers (if sync is enabled)
- Never transmitted to our servers or any third party
- Completely under your control and can be deleted at any time

## Clipboard and Text Access
The extension requests permission to read clipboard content and access text you select in a webpage. This is essential for its core functionality.

- The extension reads text in two scenarios:
  1. **From your clipboard** when you click the extension icon.
  2. **From text you have highlighted** when you use the right-click context menu.
- This text is processed temporarily in your browser's memory to find matches against your configured patterns.
- **This data is never stored, logged, or transmitted anywhere.** The process is entirely local and private.

## Permissions Explained

### `clipboardRead`
- **Why it's needed**: To read the content of your clipboard for pattern matching.
- **How it's used**: The extension reads your clipboard in two cases:
  1. When you **click the extension icon** in your browser toolbar.
  2. When you **right-click selected text** and use the context menu option.
- **Data handling**: The clipboard content is processed entirely in your browser's memory to find matches. It is **never stored, logged, or sent anywhere**.

### `storage`
- **Why it's needed**: To save your custom URL patterns and settings.
- **How it's used**: Your configurations are stored locally using the browser's sync storage, allowing your settings to be consistent across devices where you're logged in.
- **Data handling**: This data remains on your device or within your browser's sync account and is never accessed by us.

### `tabs`
- **Why it's needed**: To open new browser tabs for the URLs that match your patterns.
- **How it's used**: When a pattern is matched, the extension creates a new tab to navigate to the specified URL.
- **Data handling**: No data is stored or logged during this process.

### `contextMenus`
- **Why it's needed**: To add the "Launch URL for..." option to the right-click menu.
- **How it's used**: This allows you to launch URLs directly from text you've selected on a webpage, providing a convenient alternative to copying text first.
- **Data handling**: The selected text is handled the same way as clipboard content—processed in memory and immediately discarded.

### `offscreen`
- **Why it's needed**: To read the clipboard reliably from the extension's background service worker.
- **How it's used**: Modern Chrome extensions require a temporary, invisible offscreen document to access the clipboard from a service worker. This allows the extension to read the clipboard without needing a visible popup window every time.
- **Data handling**: This is a technical requirement for clipboard access and does not involve any extra data collection or storage.

### `host_permissions` (`<all_urls>`)
- **Why it's needed**: To enable the context menu on all websites and to open tabs for any URL you configure.
- **How it's used**:
  1. The `<all_urls>` permission is required for the right-click context menu to appear on any page you visit.
  2. It also ensures that the extension can open a new tab to any URL you define in your patterns (e.g., `your-instance.service-now.com`, `your-domain.atlassian.net`, etc.).
- **Data handling**: This permission does **not** allow the extension to read the content of web pages. It is used strictly for adding the context menu and opening tabs.

## Third-Party Services
This extension does **NOT** use any third-party services, including:
- No analytics platforms
- No advertising networks
- No tracking services
- No remote servers
- No external APIs

## Children's Privacy
Our extension does not knowingly collect information from children under 13. The extension is designed for professional productivity use.
